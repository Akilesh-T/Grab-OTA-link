## A simple shell script to grab the OTA link from logcat

Make sure you have installed adb in you computer.
If not install it from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools).
Also, make sure adb debugging is enabled in your phone.

If you're using Windows, download this repo & move it to the folder where you have the adb binary and have the proper drivers installed.

To run the script, use `./OTALink.sh`
